# Authenticated Encryption 

I spent quite a bit of time researching the history and current state of
authenticated encryption for my [master's thesis](https://github.com/mattkelly/masters-thesis-authenticated-encryption).
The goal of this repository is to:

* Gather all of that research, especially on the history of authenticated
  encryption, into one easily digestible document
* Provide a snapshot of the current state of authenticated encryption

TODO everything!
